# Lists

Lists let you organize and manage structured data with custom fields.

## Creating a List

1. Go to **Lists** from the top navigation
2. Click **New List**
3. Enter a title and optional description
4. Define your schema (fields) using the form builder

## Schema and Fields

Each list has a **schema** that defines what data you can store:

- **Field types**: Text, number, date, email, URL, select, checkbox, and more
- **Validation**: Required fields, min/max values, patterns
- **Help text**: Add hints for each field to guide users

## Child Lists

Lists can have a parent-child relationship, forming a tree:

- Create a parent list first (e.g., "Projects")
- When creating a new list, optionally set a parent
- Use breadcrumbs to navigate up and down the hierarchy

## Adding Rows

Once your schema is set:

1. Open a list
2. Click **Add Row**
3. Fill in the form

You can edit rows by clicking the edit icon in the table, or delete rows if needed.

## Editing the Schema

Click **Edit Schema** on a list to change its fields. You can add, remove, or modify fields. Existing data will be preserved where possible.

## Public vs Private

- **Private lists** (default): Only you can see and edit them
- **Public lists**: Set "Public" when creating or editing to make them visible to others
