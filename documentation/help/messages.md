# Messages

Messages are time-series posts similar to micro-blogging. Share updates, links, and media with your followers.

## Posting a Message

1. Go to **Dashboard**
2. Type your message in the input field
3. Use the visibility toggle to set public or private
4. Click to post

## Visibility

- **Public**: Visible to anyone (when viewing your profile or the feed)
- **Private**: Only visible to you

Your default visibility is set in **Settings** under Message Settings. You can override it for each message.

## Link Previews

When you include URLs in your messages, the app fetches metadata (titles, descriptions, thumbnails) and displays preview cards. You can toggle link previews on or off in Settings.

## Images and Videos

You can attach up to 6 images or 1 video per message using the upload options. Media is stored and displayed inline with your message.

## Character Limit

Each user has a configurable message length limit (default 666 characters). Adjust it in **Settings** under Message Settings.

## Email Verification

You must verify your email address before posting messages. Check your inbox for the verification link, or request a new one from Settings.
