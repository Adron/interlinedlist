# Messages

Messages are time-series posts similar to micro-blogging. Share updates, links, and media with your followers.

## Posting a Message

1. Go to **Home** (or Dashboard; the message input appears in the left sidebar on Home)
2. Type your message in the input field
3. Use the visibility toggle to set public or private
4. Click to post

## Visibility

- **Public**: Visible to anyone (when viewing your profile or the feed)
- **Private**: Only visible to you

Your default visibility is set in **Settings** under Message Settings. You can override it for each message.

## Replies

You can reply to any message you can see. When logged in, click **Reply** under a message to open the reply form. Replies appear nested under the parent message. If a reply has sub-replies, a "+N replies" link appears; the full thread view is coming soon.

## Cross-Posting

When posting a new message, use the **advanced settings** menu (gear icon) to cross-post to Mastodon and/or Bluesky. You can select which Mastodon instances to post to and whether to post to Bluesky. This requires linked identities in **Settings → Security** (Connected Accounts).

When **replying** to a message that was cross-posted: if you follow the original author on that platform (Mastodon or Bluesky), your reply may be cross-posted automatically. If cross-posting fails, a transient error toast appears for 5 seconds.

## Viewing Preferences

Control what appears in your Home feed. Go to **Settings → View Preferences** and choose:

- **All Messages** — Your messages plus all public messages
- **My Messages** — Only your own messages
- **Following Only** — Messages from people you follow (plus your own)
- **Followers Only** — Messages from people who follow you (plus your own)

## Link Previews

When you include URLs in your messages, the app fetches metadata (titles, descriptions, thumbnails) and displays preview cards. You can toggle link previews on or off in Settings.

## Images and Videos

You can attach up to 6 images or 1 video per message using the upload options. Media is stored and displayed inline with your message.

## Character Limit

Each user has a configurable message length limit (default 666 characters). Adjust it in **Settings → Profile** (not Message Settings).

## Email Verification

You must verify your email address before posting messages. Check your inbox for the verification link, or request a new one from Settings.
