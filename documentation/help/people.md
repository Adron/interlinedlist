# People

The People page helps you manage followers, following, and follow requests.

## Access

## Features

## Pending Follow Requests

If your account is **private** (Settings → Permissions), new followers must request to follow you. The People page shows pending requests. You can approve or reject each request. Approved users become followers and can see your public messages.

## Private Accounts

When you enable **Private Account** in Settings:

- You approve or reject each request
- Existing followers remain unchanged
- Your viewing preference (e.g., Following Only) affects what messages you see from people you follow
