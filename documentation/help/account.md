# Account & Security

## Email Verification

Your email must be verified before you can post messages:

1. Check your inbox for the verification email after signup
2. Click the link in the email
3. If you didn't receive it, go to Settings → Security and click **Resend verification email**
4. Rate limit: You can resend once every 10 minutes

## Password

- **Change password**: Use Settings → Security to update your password
- **Forgot password**: If you locked yourself out, use the "Forgot password" link on the login page. Enter your email; you'll receive a reset link.

## Linked Identities (OAuth)

Connect accounts for sign-in and cross-posting:

- **GitHub**: Sign in with your GitHub account. For **GitHub-backed lists** (lists that sync with GitHub Issues), you must connect with the Issues scope. If you linked GitHub for sign-in only, go to Settings → Security and click **Reconnect for GitHub Issues**.
- **Mastodon**: Connect to your Mastodon instance (also used to cross-post messages)
- **Bluesky**: Connect to your Bluesky account (also used to cross-post messages)

Go to Settings → Security (or the Connected Accounts section on the Settings page) to link or unlink identities. Once linked, you can sign in with those providers and cross-post messages to Mastodon and Bluesky when composing.

## Private Account

If you enable **Private Account** in Settings:

- New followers must request to follow you
- You can approve or reject requests
- Existing followers remain unchanged

## Staying Secure

- Use a strong, unique password
- Keep your email address up to date
- Review linked accounts periodically and remove any you no longer use
