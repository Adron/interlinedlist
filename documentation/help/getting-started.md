# Getting Started

Welcome to InterlinedList! This guide will help you get oriented with the platform.

## Home vs Dashboard

**Home** (click the home icon) shows the main feed: your messages plus all public messages from others. The left sidebar includes the message input and your lists tree. Use this to browse and post to the broader community.

**Dashboard** (click the chart icon) shows only your own messages in a table view. It also includes Data Management (links to Exports and Settings) and your profile summary. Use this to manage your content and access exports.

## Navigation

Use the top bar to move around:

- **Home** — Main feed (your messages + all public messages)
- **Dashboard** — Your messages only, data management, profile
- **Lists** — Create and manage your lists
- **Documents** — Markdown notes and folders; sync with the CLI for local editing
- **Organizations** — Browse and join organizations
- **People** — Manage followers, following, and follow requests

Click your profile icon in the top right for the dropdown menu:

- **Settings** — Profile, preferences, security
- **My Organizations** — Organizations you belong to
- **Help** — This documentation
- **Logout** — Sign out

## First Steps

1. **Post a message** — Use the input on the Home page (left sidebar) to share an update; use the advanced options (gear) to attach images or video
2. **Create a list** — Go to Lists and click "New List" to add your first list (local or GitHub-backed)
3. **Create a document** — Go to Documents to write markdown notes in folders; sync with the CLI for local editing
4. **Follow people** — Visit People or user profiles to follow others and see their messages in your feed
5. **Watch lists** — Visit another user's profile to see their public lists; click "Watch" or "Add self as watcher" to follow a list
6. **Update your profile** — Visit Settings to add a display name, avatar, and bio

## Exports

Export your data (messages, lists, follows) from the **Exports** page. Reach it via Dashboard → Exports or the Exports link in the Data Management section.
